This class helps to make the process of
taking online tests, surveys, questionnaires
very easy.

It handles everything from creating the questions
down to randomly assigning the questions to candidates
and finally calculating the scores.

The best thing about this class is it stores the
questions in json format (in a json file) in form of
subjects. This means you can handle enjoy everything
if you prefer to use javascript or jQuery depending
on your taste.

To fully understand how this class works you need to
go through the files in the example directory from both
your browser and text editor (the comments are 
more useful, I think)

I'll be available at any of the following
addresses if you have any question or you just want to
hangout with someone like you:

Thanks for using this class and remember to have fun
while coding.
